This events turn the young Howard in a very healthy man, and was the beginning of a fantastic life trip with business interests in entertainement, real estate, aviation and aeroespace, who turn Howard in to a billionaire and one of most proeminent and eccentric figures of the 20st century.</p>
    <h3>Personal Life</h3>
    <h4><em>Romance</em></h4>

      His eating habits were also peculiar, he was capable of eating the same thing for long periods of time and had a rare fixation with peas, he only eat the small ones and putt the larger aside.
    </p>
    <h3>Business</h3>
    <h4><em>Entertainment</em></h4>
    <p>
      After inherited the empire and fortune left by his parents the main goal of is life was to create is own mark on the world for not to be seen only as an healthy playboy that got fortune on the expense of the achivements of his progenitor.</p>
      <p>His first decision was to go to Hollywood with his newly wife and start a career as movie producer, he got the funds and he know ery well the enviroment by influence of his paternal uncle, the famous novelist, screenwriter and film-director Rupert Hughes.His  first project Swell Hogan was a financial disaster, but the two that followed, Everibody's Acting(1926) and Two Arabian Knights(1927) were comercial successes,with the last one wining an Oscar. But he made his mark in the industry with <b>Hells Angels</b> in 1930, an epic aviation war film with First World War as scenario. The movie even today is defined as one of the best and with most realistic scenes of air combat.The production was an astonishing $2.5 million at the time, the movie also turn momentaneous Howard as the owner  of  the biggest private air force in the world, with almost 90 planes. In the movie more than 100 pilots were used to record the figthing scenes.This will be awake up call for Hughes to pursued is big passion, aviation as a business, making him from 1950 until his death the richest American in the world and one of the first billionaires.</p>
      <p>Hughes will make his mark in the Entertainment business with two more remarkable movies, first <b>Scarface</b> in 1932 and <b>The Outlaw</b> in 1946 the movie that launch <b>Jane Russel</b> career.</p>
      <p>The decreasing interest of Hughes in the business not stopping him to adquire a majority stake in the famous studios <b>RKO</b> in 1948, the studios once one of the biggest in Hollywood, were facing losses for several years, and the entrance of Hughes, seen as King Midas for his achivements as an businessman, only deteriorate the state of the studios, at this time Hughes health starts to getting worst everiday, and in 1955 finally he gave up of the studios, walking out with a $10 million in profit overall after selling it to General Tire and Rubber Company.
    </p>
    <h4><em>Aviation and Airlines</em></h4>
    <p>Since young, aviation was his biggest passion, Hughes was a skilled pilot, with enumorous airplanes for his private use, while pursuing his entertainment businesses he set various records in aviation, as the airspeed record in 1935 with his <b>H1-Racer</b>, the first airplane buit by his <b>Hughes Aircraft</b>, a company created only with the proposal of building airplanes for his private use, and in 1938 the round-the-world flight record in just 91 hours.</p>
    <p>This achievements led Hughes to be considered an American hero.
    Also he start to realize how the airline business will get a boom in the next years due to the evolution of the aviation technology, so in 1939 he start to buy interest in <b>TWA</b>, a strugling Californian airline, by 1944 he have full control of the company that he will transfom it in an transcontinental airline(by this time only Pan Am got that statue).</p>
    <p>At the same time his Hughes Aircaft start to work for the goverment as one of the new defense contractors during the WWII, first they developed the <b>Hughes D-2</b>, that was conceived as a five crew member bomber, but the militaries don't aproved the airplane, and instead ordered 100 of a reconaissance development airplane of the D-2, and that was the controversial and near fatal <b>XF-11</b>.
    The date <b>July 7,1946</b>, was an important date in Hughes life, because it was in that day that he crashed the XF-11 during an flight test and nearly die, the physical and psicological consequences of this accident, was considered by a lot as the trigger to the decreasing of physical an mental sanity of Hughes due to his new dependency on painkillers and antidepressives medications.</p>

    <p>But the biggest, more complex and known project was the construction of the flying boat, known as the <b>H-4 Hercules</b> or <i>Spruce Goose</i> for is critics, it was the largest aircraft made of wood(Duramold process), with the biggest wingspan at 319 feet and 11 inches and also the most heavies aircraft ever built(this records only got broken more than 40 years later), the plane only flew once for one mile and 70 feet above the water in Long Beach harbour on November 2,1947 with Hughes at the commands, it was a common practice for Hughes to test his planes.
    After this flight the Hercules stayed at the Long Beach harbour and Hughes ordered to be built an  enormous climate-controlled hangar around it, with a full-time crew of 300 workers only to maintain the plane in flight conditions, in 1962 the crew was reduced to nearly 50 persons.After the death of Hughes in 1976 the crew was disbanded and the plane was finally sold in 1980 to a private company.The plane stay today in display at the <b>Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum</b> in Mcinville, Oregon.</p>

    <h3>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</h3>
    <p>Created in 1953, initially located in <b>Miami, Florida</b>(currently in <b>Chevy Chase, Maryland</b>), is currently today the fifth wealthiest charitable foundation in the world and the number one in biological and medical research with $23.8 billion in endowment.</p>
    <p>It was created with the goal of biomedical research after Hughes first will(not really valid, as we going to see ahead) in 1925 stipulated that is estate will be used to create a medical institute, but the real initial purpose of the institute was a way of Hughes avoid IRS taxes, so Hughes gave all his stock in the Hughes Aircraft Company to the institute, thereby turning the aerospace and defense contractor into a for-profit entity of a fully tax-exempt charity. Hughes' internist, Verne Mason, who treated Hughes after his 1946 aircraft crash, was chairman of the institute's medical advisory committee. The Howard Hughes Medical Institute's new board of trustees sold Hughes Aircraft in 1985 to General Motors for $5.2 billion, allowing the institute to grow dramatically.</p>
    <p>In 1954, Hughes transferred Hughes Aircraft to the foundation, which paid Hughes Tool Co. $18,000,000 for the assets. The foundation leased the land from Hughes Tool Co., which then subleased it to Hughes Aircraft Corp. The difference in rent, $2,000,000 per year, became the foundation's working capital.</p>
    <p>The deal was the topic of a protracted legal battle between Hughes and the Internal Revenue Service, which Hughes ultimately won. After his death in 1976, many thought that the balance of Hughes' estate would go to the institute, although it was ultimately divided among his cousins and other heirs, given the lack of a will to the contrary.</p>
    <h3>Later life</h3>
    <p>As refered previously, Hughes was eccentric and carry some strange phobias by nature, and the accident with the XF-11 was the main trigger to the is physical/mental decline and most visible his social disappearance.
    <h4><i>The owner of Las Vegas</i></h4>
    <p>After the theater incident of 1958, Hughes moved in to a bungalow in the Beverly Hills Hotel. Some sources said that his days were passed sitted naked with only a pink napkin placed over his genitals, watching movies.It turn to be quite normal to Hughes stay completed naked, it most be due to Hughes been suffering of <b>allodynia</b> (a physical condition that results in a pain response to stimuli that normally not cause pain) since the XF-11 accident, records said that in one year Hughes spent nearly $11 million at the hotel.
      Hughes and his army of aides start to move from one hotel to another, fixing always at the top floors penthouses, vanishing from the public eyes, once one of the most visible men, this led to a serie of rumours about his behaviour and lifestyle, with rumours that he was terminally ill and even dead.
      On the <b>24 of November,1966</b> Hughes and his entourage arrived at Las Vegas and set his headquarters at the penthouse of the <b>Desert Inn</b>. After some months and the insistence of the owners to the Hughes teeam to leave he decided to buy the hotel, seing the potential of the casino business, Hughes over the next two years bought several other hotel-casino, and start to buy lands around the city, this turn the Hughes organization in the main employer and owner of real estate in Nevada.
      Hughes loved Las Vegas and he wants to turn the city more glamourous and futuristic, aiming to do big investiments in various infrastructures, but ending materializing almost none.
      During this period, the eccentric behaviour of Hughes manifested several times:
      <ul>
        <li>Hughes buy the <b>Silver Slipper</b> casino only for the purpose of moving is neon trademark, because he kept him awake at night;</li>
        <li>Hughes bought the local tv station, <b>KLAS-TV</b> because he want to decide what movies will be shown on tv;</li>
        <li>Hughes became fond of Baskin-Robbin's banana nut ice cream, when the flavour was discontinued, he instruct his aides to buy all the remainder stock they could find(around 350 gallons or 1300 liters), but a few days after this he decide that he as enough with the banana flavour and now only wants vanilla ice cream, so the Desert Inn ended up offering banana nut ice cream to it's costumers for a whole year;</li>
        <li>Hughes phobia of germs and contamination led him to disaproved the use of the Nevada desert for nuclear testing, so he try to convince the US president to move the tests elsewhere, offering to pay all the expenses of that move.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Exactly four years after arrived at Vegas Hughes left as he came, in secrecy in the middle of the night.
      He's last years where passed beetwen penthouse hotel's in <b>Nassau, Freeport, Vancouver, London, Managua</b> and finally <b>Acapulco</b>.</p>
    <h3>Death</h3>
    <p> On April 5,1976 at 1.27pm Hughes die on board of an aircraft that was bringing him to the <b>Methodist Hospital</b> in Houston.</p>
    <p>His reclusiveness and possibly his drug use made him practically unrecognizable. His hair, beard, fingernails, and toenails were long, his tall 6 ft 4 in (193 cm) frame now weighed barely 90 pounds (41 kg), and the FBI had to use fingerprints to conclusively identify the body. Howard Hughes' alias, John T. Conover, was used when his body arrived at a morgue in Houston on the day of his death.</p>
    <p>A subsequent autopsy recorded kidney failure as the cause of death. Hughes was in extremely poor physical condition at the time of his death. He suffered from malnutrition and was covered in bedsores. While his kidneys were damaged, his other internal organs, including his brain, which had no visible damage other than illnesses, were deemed perfectly healthy. X-rays revealed five broken-off hypodermic needles in the flesh of his arms. To inject codeine into his muscles, Hughes had used glass syringes with metal needles that easily became detached.</p>
    <p>Hughes is buried next to his parents at Glenwood Cemetery in Houston.</p>

    <h4>Estate</h4>
    <p>After his death, Hughes estate  became one of the most controversial, and highlighted subjects in media of all times and was involved in continuous turmoil at the courts for several years.</p>
    <p>His eccentricity led him to never write a valid will, so inumorous will's start to appear all over the places, being the <b>Mormon will</b> the most famous</p>
    <p>Finally in 1983 his $2.5 billion estate, was split among 22 cousins.</p>

               This was one of the last public appearances of Howard Hughes.
             </li>
           </ul>
         <li><b>1950-1960</b>
           <ul>
             <li> This decade start to show the physical and psicological decline of Hughes, with his awkards episodes and reclusive state, wandering from location to location. In business things were doing well, the Hughes Aircaft was turned into one of the biggest defense contractors of US, the Toolco continuous to generate tons of revenue and TWA was satrting to "fly high", only the sold of the RKO studios seems to be a down moment.At personal life the highlight moment was his marriage with Jean Peter's on January 12, 1957.</li>
           </ul>
         </li>
         <li><b>1960-1970</b>
           <ul>
             <li>living completely in a reclusive state, Hughes settledown in Vegas in 1966, becoming over the next four years the biggest employer in the state of Nevada being the owner of several casinos, resorts, mining locations and other business. By the end of the decade rumours that he was terminal ill or in fact dead, with his aides running the business, start to increase in the media. In 1966 after a legal battle because of a lawsuit filed by the administration of TWA against the Toolco, Hughes was forced to sell his 78% of interest in the airline, receiving at the time what was considered the biggest check paid to a single person $546,549,771.</li>
           </ul>
         </li>
         <li><b>1970-1976</b>
           <ul>
             <li> On Thanksgiving Day of 1970, exactly four years after Hughes arrived at Las Vegas he departed from the city through a fire escape of the Desert Inn, lying on a bed, four years in the city, and beside his aides no one see Hughes and he neve leave his bedroom in the Desert Inn, even his frontman at the time <b>Robert Maheu</b> only spoke with Hughes by phone. Hughes then never settledown again, jumping from city to city. In the same year he and Jean Peters divorced, she claims that she hasn't seen Hughes for years and they also only comunicate by phone.<b>1972</b> was a striking year for Hughes, he suffered from an hoax perpetuated by the writer Clifford Irving, that claim that Hughes hired him to write his autobiography, obliging Hughes to make a teleconference exposing the all hoax, it was the last time Hughes voice was to be heard outside his inner circle. Aware that he in fact was losing the control of his life and wishes to the so called "Mormon-Mafia", the name called to is inner circle led by Frank Gay, was the fact that Hughes sold the tool division of the Hughes Tool Company, influenced by Gay and his partners, proud of using his name in all of his ventures, the adoption of Summa Corporation has the name for the holding of his remaining business interests dissatisfied Hughes and make clear to him that he is no longer at the wheel of his empire.
               <p>The last four years of his life where painful and even more declining, with Hughes lying in bed all the time, with the last place he lived, the Acapulco Fairmont Princess Hotel, his health increasingly got worse in the beginning of April, 1976, and on the April 5, 1976 at 1.27 pm Hughes died on board of an airplane that was to carry him to an hospital in Houston. In the words of the last physician, to see Hughes alive, his physical appearence resemble to the WWII concentration camp prisioners. His 6ft'4(193cm) frame only weighed barely 90 pounds(41 kg), the posterior X-Ray's revealed that Hughes die with 5 broken hypodermic needles in the flesh of his arms. the death was cause by kidney failure due to malnutrition and years of drug use. What was amazing his that Hughes had an army of personal physician at his service 24/7.</p>
               <p>Has someone once said Hughes could buy the life that he wants and he ended buying an miserable and painful one.</p>
